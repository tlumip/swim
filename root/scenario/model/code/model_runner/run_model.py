    Runs the model using a command list file, which essentially lists
    the sequential command line calls needed to run a model. All commands
    in the file are of the form 
    
        [error] type command_list
    
    where all the commands prefixed by "error" are skipped until (if) any
    of the calls returns abnormally/in error, in which case *only* those
    commands are executed. Type can be "call", "start", or "log". "call"
    waits for the process to finish, and the "start" just starts it and
    moves on to the next command. (A "start" command cannot put this
    script into an "error" mode.) The command list is a string that is
    a list of the program and program arguments that would be correctly
    parsed to a list by Python. Here is an example line:
    
        call ['c:\\some_program.exe','arg1','arg2']
    
    The "log" type logs a message to the report file, and its command list
    only contains one entry (the message).
