# SWIM
This is the model repository for the Oregon Statewide Integrated Model (SWIM).

This is the full and complete model software, but the model network along with the initial matrices are not included and therefore official model runs cannot be completed. To access these files, please see ODOT staff.

The complete user's guide can be found on this repos wiki.
