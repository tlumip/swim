/**
 * A ZPAttribute is a class that contains the informatioin about the route choice between zone pairs on a congested network,
 * by a given mode and for a person with given TravelPreferences. <p>
 * This is the lightweight version, which only stores the final result.  Generally one would use the heavier weight version
 * FatZPAttribute to invistigate the paths, then use the supplied constructor to create a lightweight version.  An alternative
 * would be to to store the numbers (cost, times) directly in arrays.  This would save on memory and processing but would make
 * code maintenance and debugging harder. <p> Responsibilities: C:1 - find the path for a given zone pair.
